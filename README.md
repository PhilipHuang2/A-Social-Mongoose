# A-Social-Mongoose
This project is creating an API endpoint for a social media front end that I will never see.  In alot of ways its similar to learning how to use MYSQL2 and setting up a database there as well.  Alot of the same concepts go there as well.  Each Endpoint does one action to the database, and learning how the specific database work is the real work.

MongoDB is simplier than MySql it feels like.  MySQL feels like it belongs more on a excel spreadsheet than used with a programming language while MongoDB is object based so it feels more comfortable to setup.  The downside is that relationships take longer to setup and more effort to maintain.  Perhaps there is something as powerful as the MYSQL cascade method in MongoDB but I couldn't find it.  It made things difficult to keep track of which thoughts belongs to which user and vica versa.

I have however happy to have learn MongoDB, it sounds useful for my other projects in the future.
